This mod is designed to replace pafiledb for phpBB3.0.X

I have tried to keep the same functionality and database tables/entries to allow importing of existing pafiledb database tables...
The mod will allow users to upload and download file based on permissions set by Admin...
It supports multiple categories, various license types, mirror lists and permits comments...
File type can be as determined by the administrator including, zip, arc, images etc...

Image type support thumbs and possibly a water mark if I get time...

This is a complete rewrite although I may use small section of the original provided it does not contain potential security risks..
